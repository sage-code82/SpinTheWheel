With so much to learn why not spin a wheel to help me decide!

Version 1. Wheel spins when the button is pressed and chooses a random categrory 18.11.23

Version 2. Currently working on this, to be able to add, edit and remove sections. Started work on 4.12.23

Update - version 2 is currently not working how I would want it to. The add button and delete button work but only on items that I add after the original 6. They also are put in random shapes in the wheel and not consistent to the wheel.
